      <h2>Big Ideas</h2>
      <p>The subject of this lab is to get more familiar with CSS using more advacned CSS Layout Methods.
        In this lab we made more complex CSS layouts including Float Layout, Flexbox Layout, and Grid Layout.</p>

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>For the most part this lab was for the most part successful. It was kind of complicated trying to figure out how to code the new types of layouts.
      However, this lab wasn't too difficult and we didn't have hardly any issues.</p>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>The results of this lab are displayed in this website. This lab was pretty successful and we were able to complete it fully.
