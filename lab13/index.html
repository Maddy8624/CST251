        <h2>Big Ideas</h2>
        <p>The subject of this lab is to get more familiar with CSS using Advanced Typography.
        In this lab we will be using Typography methods in CSS to recreate an already existing website.
        This will help us get more equipped with using different CSS Typography methods we may not have thought of before.</p>

        <p>For the most part this lab went decently alright. It took us a while to match our fake website to the real website.
          However, we undertood what we were doing and what we had to do. I did have a problem trying to get the cirlces flush to the edges of the screen, but other than that it looks alright.</p>
