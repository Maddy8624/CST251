        <h2>Big Ideas</h2>
        <p>The subject of this lab is to get more familiar with CSS using Advanced Typography.
        In this lab we will be using Typography methods in CSS to recreate an already existing website.
        This will help us get more equipped with using different CSS Typography methods we may not have thought of before.</p>
