        <h2>Big Ideas</h2>
        <p>The subject of this lab is to get more familiar with CSS using Advanced Typography.
        In this lab we will be using Typography methods in CSS to recreate an already existing website.
        This will help us get more equipped with using different CSS Typography methods we may not have thought of before.
        This lab is exactly like Lab 14. We just have to redo a harder website then the one we did in Lab 13.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>For the most part this lab went decently alright. It took us a while to match our fake website to the real website.
          However, this lab was a lot easier than Lab 13 just because this lab was a repeat of Lab 13 and we had a better idea of what we were doing.</p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The results of this lab are displayed in this website. This lab was successfully created. This was also a very fun lab to complete.
        This webapage doesn't look exactly like the original but I am proud of how close I got. I think this lab looks better than Lab 13.
        This is good because that means that we are improving our coding skills.</p>
