        <p>Hi my name is Maddy and here are some random facts about me.
          I love to hike and go exploring outside. I'm like to do photohgraphy in my free time.
          One day I hope to work for the film industry and work on movie sets as a graphic designer.
          My favoprite colors are light blue and neutral pinks.
          My favorite season is fall and I love everything pumpkin spice related. (Basic I know)
          My favorite holiday is Thanksgiving because of the food and the weather.
          I hope you enjoyed these random facts.</p>

        <h2>Big Ideas</h2>
        <p>The subject of this lab is to get more familiar with CSS using more Advanced Block-level styling methods.
        Some of these methods include using different postion tags when stylizing our pictures and text elements.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Overall, this lab was very successful and we didn't have many problems.
          It did take us a little bit how to make our aside bars on the right hand side of the webpage, but after that everything went smoothly.
        However, while we did get the aside bars to work, we had trouble getting the rest of our content to go next to it. We will ask this question in class. </p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The results of this lab are displayed in this website. I was able to stylize the text elements and pictures the way I wanted it thanks to using Advanced Block-level styling. I was also able to fully complete this lab.</p>
