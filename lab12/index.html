        <h2>Big Ideas</h2>
        <p>The subject of this lab is to get more familiar with CSS using more Advanced Block-level styling methods.
        Some of these methods include using different postion tags when stylizing our pictures and text elements.
        This lab is the second part to Lab 11. However, in this lab we are using float and centering techniques. </p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>We had quiet a few problems with this lab. We were not able to center our pictures.
          So we were able to center the pictures in the middle of the webpage but not in the middle of the content box. I tried everything I could think of but nothing worked.  </p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The results of this lab are displayed in this website. I did my best but it doesn't look great. I followed all of the criteria but the webpage still looks odd.</p>
