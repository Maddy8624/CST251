        <h2>Big Ideas</h2>
        <p>The subject of this lab is to get more familiar with CSS using more Advanced Block-level styling methods.
        Some of these methods include using different postion tags when stylizing our pictures and text elements.
        This lab is the second part to Lab 11. However, in this lab we are using float and centering techniques. </p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Overall, this lab was very successful and we didn't have many problems.
          It did take us a little bit how to make our aside bars on the right hand side of the webpage, but after that everything went smoothly.
        However, while we did get the aside bars to work, we had trouble getting the rest of our content to go next to it. We will ask this question in class. </p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The results of this lab are displayed in this website. I was able to stylize the text elements and pictures the way I wanted it thanks to using Advanced Block-level styling. I was also able to fully complete this lab.</p>
