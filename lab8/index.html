    <h2>Big Ideas</h2>
    <p>The subject of this lab is to get more familiar with using CSS.
       How a big part of this lab is using CSS selectors to stylize and personalize our webiste.
       Each of the ids and classes we set in our index.html source code will be customized with CSS selectors.</p>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>There weren't any major challeneges when completeing this lab. However, it is still taking some time to get use to CSS because it does involve different formating from HTML.
       Since I am still getting use to CSS it is taking me a little bit longer to finish the lab.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The results of this lab are displayed in this website. I was able to stylize it the way I wanted it. I was also able to fully complete this lab.</p>
