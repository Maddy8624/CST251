	<h2>Big Idea</h2>
	<p>The subject of this lab is use more complicated HTML to develop a website.
	This lab will also help us learn how to make a CSS file and add it to out HTML source code in order to customize our website.
We will also be adding a form where people can take a survey.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>This lab is a lot more complciated then we are use too, but it wasn't too difficult overall.
	The only challenege was trying to get the form just right. It still is not working completely right. I will ask for help in class.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>The results show in the entirety of this website. Overall, we were able to complete the lab fully and correctly.</p>
