        <h2>Big Ideas</h2>
        <p>The subject of this lab is to create some quick sketches for our final team website.
          I took 3 sketches from the last lab, and developed these ideas more fully.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="challenge">
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>This lab didn't give me any challeneges. The only challenege was maybe trying to make my ideas more developed, but that wasn't a major problem.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="results">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The results of this lab are displayed in this website. This lab was pretty successful and I was able to complete it fully.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="feedback">
        <h2>Feedback</h2>
        <p>Some feedback that I got on my sketches is mostly positive. My team really liked the idea of putting pictures in a clipping mask to add more of a shape.
          For instance, I had a few sketches where the photos were circles, not regular squares or rectangles. This added more demension to the webapage.
          Another thing my team gave me feedback on was my variety of differnt navigation bar menu options. My team is still unsure of the exact style we want the navigation,
          so I took the three styles my team liked the most and incorporated them into my new refined sketches. My team also said maybe my next sketches should still incorporated
          the elements that make it pop, but make it simplier. Since our website is almost a food blog, the website needs to represent a simplistic yet infomrational style.
          I took all of this feedback and created three new sketches that are more refined and thoughtout.</p>
