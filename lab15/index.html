        <h2>Big Ideas</h2>
        <p>The subject of this lab is to get more familiar with CSS using more fancier CSS methods.
          In this lab we added more sophistication to our webpages by adding text-shadows, box-shadows, gradients, filters, rounded corners, object-fit, and transform.
          These techniques made our webpage look fancier than before.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Overall, this lab was very successful and we didn't have many problems. The only challenge we had was adding a graident.
          However, we were able to quickly resolve this issue by realizing we made tiny formatting mistakes.</p>
