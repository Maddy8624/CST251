        <h2>Big Ideas</h2>
        <p>The subject of this lab is to get more familiar with CSS using more fancier CSS methods.
          In this lab we added more added more complex CSS features including multiple-background images, transitions, animations, and columns.
          These techniques made our webpage look fancier than before.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>For the most part this lab was decently successful. While I was able to do transitions, animations, and columns pretty easily,
          I had the hardest time getting my background images to work. I eventually realized that the images that I downloaded to my computer weren't working.
        So I eventually just took images directly from the internet and used the direct url to make the two background images. One image is marble and another is the roses.</p>

        <div id="results">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The results of this lab are displayed in this website. This lab was pretty successful and we were able to complete it fully.
        I think overall the webpage looks sophisticated and border-line professional. The animation was difficult so I took and credited some code from the internet to get a reference point.</p>
