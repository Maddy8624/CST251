			<h1>Lab 4: File Transfer</h1>
			<p>For this assignment, we had to create and publish a webpage using proper filing techniques.
				First we had to test files locally, then once everything looked alright, we published to the web.</p>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>There weren't any challeneges when trying to complete this assignment.
				We used our skills we gained from the other labs to successfully create the index.html for Lab 4.</p>
