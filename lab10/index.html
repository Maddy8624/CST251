        <h2>Big Ideas</h2>
        <p>The subject of this lab is to get more familiar with using CSS text elements to stylize our index.html.
        This lab will allow us to be more creative with how we stylize our text in our website.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Overall, this lab was very successful and we didn't have many problems. This lab was very similar to Lab 9.
        However, for this lab we stylized text elements instead of block elements. I'm still trying to geain speed doing CSS, but so far no real issues.</p>
